Titanic Prediction – More Than Just a Model!
Recently, I worked on a Titanic prediction project — not just to predict survival, but to understand the true power of ML pipelines. 

At first, I was focused only on choosing the right algorithm. But soon I realized: without a proper pipeline, managing preprocessing, feature encoding, scaling, missing values, and model training becomes chaotic. 💥

That’s when I learned:

 Pipelines keep everything organized and repeatable

 They save you from rewriting code again and again

You can chain steps together so your workflow becomes automatic

Pipelines help during model deployment and cross-validation

They reduce human error in complex ML tasks
Imagine building a house with no blueprint. That’s what machine learning feels like without a pipeline. 🏗

 I want to share this message with all beginners and learners:

Pipeline is not just an option; it’s a foundation in your machine learning journey.
Without it, you’ll waste hours fixing preprocessing bugs and repeating steps manually.

Tools like Pipeline and ColumnTransformer from scikit-learn are your best friends in building clean and reliable ML workflows.

 And yes — I did complete the prediction using test input at the end. The model successfully predicted survival using the full pipeline.

I personally want to tell you:
Pipelines are a crucial part of every ML engineer’s life. Learn them early, and they’ll save you countless hours and mistakes
